# RaycastEngine - WIP
RaycastEngine in C++ project

## Important Observation
This project is beign made using C++, SDL and QuickCG
QuickCG is a smal SDL codebase, it's meant to be simple and for tech computer graphics. 
I had the plan to use OpenGL 3.0, but notice that learn it out that more time that i have now and would go far from what i want to learn with this project
I do have plan to do a version of this on OpenGL in the future
