# RaycastEngine - WIP
RaycastEngine in C++ project

## Important Observation
This project is beign made using C++, SDL and QuickCG <br>
QuickCG is a smal SDL codebase, it's meant to be simple and to learn basic computer graphics. <br>
I had the plan to use OpenGL 3.0, but notice that learn it would that more time than i have now and was going to far from what i want to learn with this project<br>
I do have plan to do a version of this on OpenGL in the future<br>
